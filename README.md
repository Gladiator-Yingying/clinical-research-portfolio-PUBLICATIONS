#üåçSAVING LIFES - Clinical Research Publications | Yingying Huang

## üî¨ Overview  
This repository presents a selection of my research contributions in clinical data analysis and outcome modeling, including work on sepsis, ICU risk stratification, and emergency department outcomes. These projects reflect my transition from medical research to AI-enhanced clinical modeling.

### üìù 1. [Establishment and Effectiveness Evaluation of a Scoring System-RAAS (RDW, AGE, APACHE II, SOFA) for Sepsis by a Retrospective Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35082513/)  
**Role**: First Author  
**Journal**: *Frontiers in Public Health*, 2022  
**Summary**: This study established a novel scoring system‚ÄîRAAS‚Äîbased on RDW, age, APACHE II, and SOFA scores to predict sepsis outcomes. The model was validated on ICU sepsis patients and showed strong predictive value for 28-day mortality.  
**Keywords**: Sepsis, Prognosis, Scoring System, RAAS, ICU Mortality  
**Contribution**: First author; led data extraction, statistical analysis, and manuscript writing

### üìù 2. [Risk Stratification of ICU Patients with Cardiac Disease: A Multicenter Retrospective Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38764494/)  
**Role**: Co-Author   
**Journal**: *Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine*, 2024  
**Summary**: Analyzed clinical outcomes of ICU patients with various cardiovascular diagnoses across multiple hospitals. The study developed a multivariable regression model to identify mortality-related predictors.  
**Keywords**: ICU, Cardiology, Prognostic Modeling, Multicenter Study  
**Contribution**: Data analysis, regression modeling, interpretation

### üìù 3. [A Simple Scoring System to Predict Hospital Admission for Elderly Emergency Patients with Multiple Chronic Diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39720697/)  
**Role**: Co-Author  
**Journal**: *BMC Emergency Medicine*, 2024  
**Summary**: Designed a clinical scoring tool based on routine triage data to assist in early identification of elderly patients needing hospitalization. The tool incorporated comorbidity profiles and vital signs to estimate risk of admission.  
**Keywords**: Emergency Admission, Elderly Patients, Risk Stratification, Chronic Disease  
**Contribution**: Study design, statistical analysis support

### üìù 4. [Prognostic Value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index in Emergency Patients with Acute Abdominal Pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39228679/)  
**Role**: Co-Author  
**Journal**: *Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging*, 2024  
**Summary**: Evaluated the predictive value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in elderly emergency patients presenting with acute abdominal pain. Findings indicated that poor nutritional status was significantly associated with adverse outcomes.  
**Keywords**: GNRI, Acute Abdomen, Emergency Medicine, Nutritional Assessment  
**Contribution**: Data extraction, statistical support

### üìù 5. [Predictive Value of Blood Lactate in Emergency Sepsis Evaluation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34353108/)  
**Role**: Contributing Author  
**Journal**: *World Journal of Emergency Medicine*, 2021  
**Summary**: Investigated the utility of serum lactate concentration in predicting mortality and organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis. The study affirmed lactate as a useful biomarker in early ED triage.  
**Keywords**: Sepsis, Lactate, Emergency Department, Biomarkers  
**Contribution**: Case screening and data cleaning

### üìù 6. [Emergency Factors Associated with Early Mortality in Acute Stroke: A Chinese Urban Center Experience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32750426/)  - review
**Role**: Contributing Author  
**Journal**: *Brain and Behavior*, 2020  
**Summary**: Identified prehospital and early ED factors influencing early mortality in acute ischemic stroke. Findings supported early blood pressure control and imaging access to improve outcomes.  
**Keywords**: Stroke, Early Mortality, Emergency Predictors, Prehospital Delay  
**Contribution**: Case inclusion and clinical documentation review
